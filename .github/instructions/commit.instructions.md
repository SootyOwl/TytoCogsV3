# Commit instructions

When making a commit, please follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency:

- Use Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
  - Example: `feat(redvids): add support for new video formats`
- Types can include: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Scope should be the name of the cog or module affected
- Subject should be a brief description of the change (max 50 characters)
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "add", "fix", "update")
- Include a detailed body if necessary, explaining the what, why, and how of the change
- Reference any relevant issues or pull requests in the body
- End with a footer if there are breaking changes or issues closed
  - Example: `BREAKING CHANGE: description of the breaking change`
  - Example: `Closes #123`
